# Binary Search Implementation

This project implements various searching algorithms in C++, including:
- Linear search for std::array and std::vector
- Binary search for std::array and std::vector
- Binary search for first occurrence (binarySearchFirst) for both std::array and std::vector

## Files
- `Searching.cpp`: Contains the implementation of all search algorithms
- `SearchingApp.cpp`: Test application demonstrating the usage of the search functions

## Implementation Details
The `binarySearchFirst` functions find the first occurrence of a target value in a sorted container using binary search, with O(log n) complexity in the best case.

## Usage
Compile both files together and run the resulting executable. The program will prompt you to enter a target value to search for in predefined sorted arrays and vectors.
